# AI_generated_text_detection
A project to classify newspaper titles between human written and AI generated ones. This project was conducted in the scope of L'Ecole Polytechnique's course on Natural Language processing (NLP).

## Content
For this project, we explored different approaches to best classify between human written and AI generated text. Our best model was a hybrid model which combined the power of BERT based NLP models and traditional Machine Learning.

This allowed us to atteign a 92% accuracy score on a balanced data-set, earning us first place among all competitors of the associated Kaggle challenge.
